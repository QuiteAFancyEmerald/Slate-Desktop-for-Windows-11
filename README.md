# Slate-Desktop-for-Windows-11

**Slate Desktop** is a powerful Windows environment setup focused on **performance**, **productivity enhancements**, **shell modifications**, and a **modern aesthetic** tailored specifically for Windows 11. Unlike other modpacks that revert to outdated styles, Slate Desktop elevates the sleek, modern look of Windows 11 with performance and visual improvements.

One of the core principles of this project is **full transparency**â€”it avoids *hidden automation and the use of untrusted, pre-modded ISOs*. Instead, Slate Desktop employs a seamless, CLI-based process to download assets and automatically import necessary configurations via a sources.json file. This ensures that each component of the setup is openly visible and customizable.

Made in Python it runs through `sources.json` which serves as a transparent way of grabbing every asset needed. You can check it out <a href="https://github.com/QuiteAFancyEmerald/Slate-Desktop-for-Windows-11/blob/main/sources.json"></a> to review direct links as well as a list of each project used.

### Supported Windows 11 Versions: 
`Windows 11 21H2`, `Windows 11 22H2`, `Windows 11 23H2`, `Windows 11 24H2` (Works with ANY Windows edition however **Windows 11 IoT LTSC** is *highly recommended*)

> [!TIP]
> For the best results use a fresh (legal) copy of **Windows 11 IoT LTSC**. You can get this from the official Microsoft website. LTSC is the best version of Windows 11 to utilize these scripts on as versus standard Windows 11 Home it has no bloatware or useless Windows apps pre-installed. Have a peace of mind and consider "massgravel" for those who live within the seas brrr

> [!NOTE]
> After installation simply check the `/sources` folder for each step. Some configuration files will need to be moved manually but detailed instructions are provided. More information is provided within the **Installation** section. 

> [!CAUTION]
> You are responsible for running this script. Make sure you have backups prior to utilizing Slate and ensure you are on **Windows 11 22H2/Windows 11 23H2/Windows 11 IoT LTSC**. This project will not work on **Windows 10** and will damage it!!!
