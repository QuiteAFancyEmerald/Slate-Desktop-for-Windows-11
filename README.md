# Slate-Desktop-for-Windows-11-LTSC

Slate Desktop is a powerful windows environment setup with a focus on performance, productivity features, shell mods and style unique to stock Windows 11. Unlike other theme/optimization modpacks it avoids reverting styles to older versions of Windows and instead enhances the modern look of Windows 11. 

A primary goal of this project is to utilize fully transparent applications versus bundling all assets within an untrusted ISO.
Slate Desktop features a seamless process for downloading assets and automatic config imports needed via a CLI tool. Made in Python it runs through `sources.json` which serves as a transparent way of grabbing every asset needed. You can check it out here as well as a summary of each project here.

> [!TIP]
> For the best results use a fresh (legal) copy of Windows 11 IoT LTSC. You can get this from the official Microsoft website. LTSC is the best version of Windows 11 to utilize these scripts on as versus standard Windows 11 Home it has no bloatware or useless Windows apps pre-installed. Have a peace of mind and consider "massgravel" for those who live within the seas brrr

> [!NOTE]
> After installation simply check the /sources folder for each step. Some configuration files will need to be moved manually but detailed instructions are provided. More information is provided within the Installation section. 

> [!CAUTION]
> You are responsible for running this script. Make sure you have backups prior to utilizing Slate and ensure you are on Windows 11 22H2/Windows 11 23H2/Windows 11 IoT LTSC. This project will not work on Windows 10 and will damage it!!!
